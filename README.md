# Data-Science-Labs
**Lab 01:**
This lab covers various Python programming tasks, including solving quadratic equations, filtering lists, and removing duplicates. It also demonstrates set operations, BMI calculation, sales growth estimation, and displays student GPAs. These exercises reinforce fundamental programming concepts and data manipulation skills.

**Lab 02:**
This lab tasks leverages the Pandas library to read and manipulate datasets from CSV and JSON files, merging multiple dataframes into a comprehensive dataset. It employs techniques like selective column loading, data type conversion, and handling missing values by filling them with column means. Finally, it saves the cleaned data to a new CSV file, showcasing effective data preprocessing practices in Python.

**Lab 03:**
This lab demonstrates data manipulation using Pandas and NumPy, starting with the creation and plotting of a random time series. It constructs two DataFrames from city and province data, merges them, removes duplicates, sorts the entries, and resets the index. Additionally, it cleans another DataFrame by replacing blank values, encoding categorical fields, handling negative marks, and filling in missing values with the mean before printing the results.

**Lab 04:**
This lab implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification using two datasets: the Iris dataset and an occupancy dataset. It prepares the data by loading it, splitting it into training and testing sets, and then trains a KNN model, evaluating its performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Additionally, it includes a custom KNN function that utilizes chi-squared distance for classification, demonstrating key machine learning techniques in Python.

**Lab on PCA:**
This processes multiple cancer-related datasets by performing data cleaning, standardization, and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It begins by loading five different datasets, replacing specific values for consistency, and splitting each dataset into training and testing subsets. Standardization is applied to the features, followed by PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the datasets, with cumulative explained variance plotted for each PCA model to visualize the amount of variance captured by the principal components.

**Lab on k_means_and_Silhouette_Coefficient:**
In this lab, we performed clustering analysis on two datasets related to lung cancer and prostate cancer using the K-Means algorithm. We scaled the data for better performance, visualized the clusters, and used elbow plots to determine the optimal number of clusters for each dataset. This process helps to identify patterns and groupings within the data that could inform further analysis or medical insights.

**Lab on NB and Linear Regression:**
In this lab, various machine learning techniques were applied to predict sales and classify outcomes using the Advertising dataset and other synthetic datasets. Linear regression was utilized to model sales, achieving a Mean Squared Error of approximately 3.17, while Naive Bayes classification demonstrated a high accuracy of 90% in predicting sales categories. Additionally, the lab included K-Fold cross-validation and calculations of class probabilities to assess model performance and understand data distributions.
